I would say we worked very well with that office.\"   The NSC directorate for global health and security and bio-defense survived the transition from President Barack Obama to Trump in 2017.   Trump's elimination of the office suggested, along with his proposed budget cuts for the CDC, that he did not see the threat of pandemics in the same way that many experts in the field did.   \"One year later I was mystified when the White House dissolved the office, leaving the country less prepared for pandemics like COVID-19,\" Beth Cameron, the first director of the unit, wrote in an op-ed Friday in The Washington Post.   She said the directorate was set up to be the \"smoke alarm\" and get ahead of emergencies and sound a warning at the earliest sign of fire - \"all with the goal of avoiding a six-alarm fire.\"   It's impossible to assess the impact of the 2018 decision to disband the unit, she said.

The graphic that aired Friday to illustrate market reactions to historic periods of civil unrest \"should have never aired on television without full context. We apologize for the insensitivity of the image and take this issue seriously,\" the cable channel said in a statement.   The chart included on \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" illustrated gains made by the S&P 500 index after King's assassination in 1968; the Ferguson, Missouri, police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in 2014, and the May 25 death of Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody. It also measured the financial yardstick against the 1991 acquittal of Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King.   It was shown as part of a segment with Fox News and Fox Business reporter Susan Li focusing on the market rally that followed an unexpectedly lower number of jobless claims.   Other business publications and TV channels in recent days have compared the market's performance to current and historic social upheaval, but with significant background and explanation.   Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Illinois, tweeted that the graphic makes it clear that Fox News \"does not care about black lives,\" while Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chair and a MSNBC political analyst, posted, \"This is how they mourn the loss of black men at #FoxNews - by how much the stock market goes up.\"   Baier retweeted Fox's apology without further comment.

The epidemic had struck particularly hard here in Clallam County, where generations of families from the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe live along the waterways of the Salish Sea. Simcosky, health director for the 537-member tribe, had too often seen the battered faces of neighbors and community members addicted to black tar heroin that sells for $5 a hit or to pain pills that for years saturated this remote corner of the Pacific Northwest.   Jamestown tribe leaders invested in schools, farming and aquaculture, spreading shells along the tidelands so oysters could grow. Simcosky had multimillion-dollar tribal and state commitments to finance a state-of-the art outpatient opioid treatment and healing center that would combine native practices with counseling, medical care and medications known to block the euphoric effects of opioids.   Standing in the 20-acre field, he pictured meeting rooms that faced the Olympic Mountains. A reflecting pool where patients could practice meditation. Activities that brought tribal traditions to the young.   In Washington state, with 29 federally recognized tribes, Native Americans have died of opioid overdoses at a rate nearly three times higher than that of nonnatives. For heroin alone, it was four times higher, federal data shows. The tribe planned to offer treatment to residents - native and nonnative - across two counties.   \"Indians,\" tribe Chairman Ron Allen told Simcosky, \"can be part of the solution.\"   In May 2019, the tribe bought the land. The purchase initially drew little attention in Sequim, population 7,000, a town of retirees, artisan shops and an annual..."},{"article-url":"https:\/\/www.axios.com\/trump-coronavirus-campaign-tulsa-0cba2748-3e9f-4c91-8d99-a8d7e0afa86e.html","content":"Coronavirus\nHits six Trump campaign staffers.\nIs it still a hoax?","ts-created":"2020-06-21T10:57:40-05:00","article-url-clean":"axios.com\/trump-coronavirus-campaign-tulsa-0cba2748-3e9f-4c91-8d99-a8d7e0afa86e.html","ts-posted":"2020-06-20T21:26:35-05:00","score":31783,"title":"Six Trump campaign staffers test positive for coronavirus ahead of Tulsa rally - Axios","description":"\"No COVID-positive staffers ... will be at today\u2019s rally,\" the campaign said."},{"article-url":"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/americas\/us-election\/eric-trump-rally-speech-protests-tulsa-oklahoma-a9577566.html","content":"Trump's son holds rally-\nCalls protesters animals. \nIs this great again?","ts-created":"2020-06-21T11:25:31-05:00","article-url-clean":"independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/americas\/us-election\/eric-trump-rally-speech-protests-tulsa-oklahoma-a9577566.html","ts-posted":"2020-06-21T02:39:26-05:00","score":28432,"title":"Eric Trump refers to racial justice protesters as 'animals' in Tulsa rally speech | The Independent","description":"Speaking at the his father's campaign\u00a0rally in Tulsa, the president's son Eric Trump referred to Black Lives Matter protesters as \"animals\".
